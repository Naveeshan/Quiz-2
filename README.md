# Design Decisions
The application was designed with modularity and simplicity in mind due to the 3-houe time constrain.Django and Django REST Framework were chosen for their rapid API development capabilities.Four main models were created: Employee, Attendance, Department, and Performance, with proper foreign key relationships to normalize the data. Employee contains general details, Attendance records daily presence, Department contains the department name details and Performance holds monthly ratings and remarks. The Faker library was used to quickly generate synthetic data for seeding. MySQL was selected for the database since it integrates easily with MySQL Workbench. DRF ViewSets and routers were used for efficient endpoint creation. Swagger UI was integrated using drf-yasg to allow testing and exploring endpoints visually. The focus was placed on core functionality, RESTful design, and clean code. Optional enhancements like Docker, unit testing, and data export were deprioritized to focus on completing a functional and presentable solution within the time limit.
